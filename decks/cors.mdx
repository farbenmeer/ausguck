# Cross-origin resource sharing

---

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on 
a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first 
resource was served.

---

Long Story short

Example:

farbenmeer.de want's to make a POST request to prismic.io

---

Normaly this request would fail if the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header does not set 
the value farbenmeer.de within the response from the preflight request

---

Why is this necessary?

---

Reason 1: cookies

Browser often send your cookies with http requests. Maybe you don't want evil.com to be
able to make a request to bank.com using your login cookies.

---

Reason 2: network access

You might be on a private network (farbenmeer corporate network) that evil.com doesn't
have access to, but your computer does.

---

Which requests will fail and which not?

---

Methods with mandatory preflight request

	- PUT
	- DELETE
	- CONNECT
	- OPTIONS
	- TRACE
	- PATCH

---

Methods without mandatory preflight request

	- GET
	- HEAD
	- POST
