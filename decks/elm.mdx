### How does this work?

---

`*.elm` -> compiler -> `*.js`

---

```js
let Elm = require("./App.elm"),
    node = document.getElementById('main');

Elm.App.embed(node);
```

---

```js
import Elm from 'react-elm-components'
import { Todo } from '../dist/elm/todomvc.js'

function render() {
	return <Elm src={Todo} />
}
```

const app = Elm.Main.init({

## How does HTML look like?

---

```html
<a href="https://example.com">
    <img src="product.jpg"/>
    <p class="description">Descriptive Text</p>
</a>
```

---

```html
<a href="https://example.com">
    <img src="product.jpg"/>
    <p class="description">Descriptive Text</p>
</a>
```

```elm
a [ href "https://example.com" ]
    [ img [src "product.jpg"] []
    , p [ class "description" ] [text "Descriptive Text"]
    ]
```

---

```html
<a href="https://example.com">
    <img src="product.jpg"/>
    <p class="description">Descriptive Text</p>
</a>
```

```elm
a [ href "https://example.com" ]
    [ img [src "product.jpg"] []
    , p [ class "description" ] [text "Descriptive Text"]
    ]
```
