### How does this work?

---

`*.elm` -> compiler -> `*.js`

---

```js
let Elm = require("./App.elm"),
    node = document.getElementById('main');

Elm.App.embed(node);
```

---

```js
import Elm from 'react-elm-components'
import { Todo } from '/ausguck/dist/elm/todomvc.js'

function render() {
	return <Elm src={Todo} />
}
```

## What if Elm doesn't do X?

---

## Ports

---

```elm
port module exposing (setTitle)

port setTitle : String -> Cmd msg
```

---

```js
import './main.css';
import { Elm } from './Main.elm';
import registerServiceWorker from './registerServiceWorker';

const app = Elm.Main.init({
  node: document.getElementById('root')
});

registerServiceWorker();

app.ports.playSound.subscribe(() => {
    new Audio('/sound.mp3').play();
});

app.ports.setTitle.subscribe(title => {
    document.title = title
});
```

## How does HTML look like?

---

```html
<a href="https://example.com">
    <img src="product.jpg"/>
    <p class="description">Descriptive Text</p>
</a>
```

---

```html
<a href="https://example.com">
    <img src="product.jpg"/>
    <p class="description">Descriptive Text</p>
</a>
```

```elm
a [ href "https://example.com" ]
    [ img [src "product.jpg"] []
    , p [ class "description" ] [text "Descriptive Text"]
    ]
```

---

```html
<a href="https://example.com">
    <img src="product.jpg"/>
    <p class="description">Descriptive Text</p>
</a>
```

```elm
a [ href "https://example.com" ]
    [ img [src "product.jpg"] []
    , p [ class "description" ] [text "Descriptive Text"]
    ]
```

// sorry, no syntax highlighting for elm code :(
