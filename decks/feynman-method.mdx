# Feynman method

by Marcel Hoppe  
([github](https://github.com/Kampfheizung))

Richard Feynman was an american physicist and nobelist. He disovered in 1935 his interest in the quantum mechanics.

---

Unfortunately this subject was totaly new at this time and his university had no course about quantum mechanics. So
he learned with his own constructed method, which later became known as the feynman method.

HOWTO Feynman Method:

* Write the topic you want to learn as a headline in the middle of the first line of the notepad
* Write down everything you know about this topic
* Then you write down an explanation about the topic, as if you would explain it to a small child.
* If you do not immediately succeed in presenting a complex topic so easily, you can look it up in your books and learning materials

The goal should be that you become aware of all your knowledge gaps and then close them by looking up.
In the end, write down your simplistic explanation. If necessary, you can further simplify the explanation if it seems too difficult for you.
