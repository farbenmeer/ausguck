# Race Conditions

---

What exactly is a race condition?

---

A race condition occurs when two or more threads can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time.

---

## Synchronous

| Thread 1 | Thread 2 |   | Value |
|----------|----------|---|-------|
|          |          |   |   0   |
|  read    |          | ← |   0   |
| increase |          |   |   0   |
|  write   |          | → |   1   |
|          |   read   | ← |   1   |
|          | increase |   |   1   |
|          |   write  | → |   2   |

---

## Asynchronous

| Thread 1 | Thread 2 |   | Value |
|----------|----------|---|-------|
|          |          |   |   0   |
|  read    |          | ← |   0   |
|          |   read   | ← |   0   |
| increase |          |   |   0   |
|          | increase |   |   0   |
|  write   |          | → |   1   |
|          |   write  | → |   1   |

## Example of a linked list

---

Refresher on Linkedlists:

```
Node {
    value 
    *next
}
```

---

We want to remove two items from a linked list

---

---

<img src="/images/race-conditions/linked_list_1.png" />  
<img src="/images/race-conditions/linked_list_2.png" />

---

<img src="/images/race-conditions/linked_list_1.png" />  
<img src="/images/race-conditions/linked_list_2.png" />  
<img src="/images/race-conditions/linked_list_3.png" />

---

## Solution: Locks

---

```
if (x == 5) {
   // If another thread changed x in between 
   // "if (x == 5)" and "y = x * 2" above,
   // y will not be equal to 10.
   y = x * 2; 
}
```

---

```
// Obtain lock for x
if (x == 5) {
   // Now, nothing can change x until the lock is released. 
   // Therefore y = 10
   y = x * 2; 
}
// release lock for x

```

---

In `C` there is: `mlock(*address, length)` and `mlockall(flags)`
as well as corresponding `munlock` and `munlockall`.  
More modern languages like Rust for example doesn't need this.

---

This can also affect javascript with async code, a solution for this would be 
[async-lock](https://www.npmjs.com/package/async-lock)

---

```
redis.get('key', function(err, value) {
    redis.set('key', value * 2);
});
```

---

```
user1: redis.get('key') -> 1
user2: redis.get('key') -> 1
user1: redis.set('key', 1 x 2) -> 2
user2: redis.set('key', 1 x 2) -> 2
```

---

```
var AsyncLock = require('async-lock');
var lock = new AsyncLock();

const multiplyValueFromRedis = async (key, callback) => {
    lock.acquire(key, () => {
    // no other can obtain the same lock at the same time
        redis.get(key, (err, value) => {
            redis.set(key, value * 2, callback);
        });
    }, (err, ret) => {
    // do something when no lock can be obtained
    });
}

await myAsyncFunc();
```
