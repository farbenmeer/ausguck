# SQL queries don't start with SELECT

### How do you think get this sql statement evaluated?

```sql
SELECT name, weight FROM cats WHERE weight > 9;
```

---

### First

```sql
FROM cats
```

---

### Second

```sql
WHERE weight > 9
```

---

### Last

```sql
SELECT name, weight
```

### But now you think - "what about column aliases?"

---

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS fat_cat, weight
FROM cat
WHERE weight > 9
GROUP BY fat_cat
```

# 🤔

### "This query makes it look like GROUP BY happens after SELECT even though GROUP BY is first, 

### because the GROUP BY references an alias from the SELECT."

### Database engines can just rewrite the query as

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS fat_cat, weight
FROM cat
WHERE weight > 9
GROUP BY CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name)
```
