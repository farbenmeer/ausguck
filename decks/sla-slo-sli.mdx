# SLO, SLI and SLA

- SLO or service level object is a goal that service provider wants to reach.
- SLA or service level agreement is a contract that the service provider promises  
	customers on service availability, performance, etc.
- SLI or service level indicator is a measurement the service provider uses for the goal.

---

# SLO

Every service should have an availability SLO—without it, your team and your stakeholders  
cannot make principled judgments about whether your service needs to be made more reliable  
(increasing cost and slowing development) or less reliable (allowing greater velocity of development).

---

# Example SLO

99% availability — 1.68 hours downtime per week

"Within Google, we implement periodic downtime in some services to prevent a service from being overly available."

---

# SLA

If money is involved, we need to specify in the contract how available the customer can expect  
the service to be, and what happens if we breach that agreement. But keep in mind that the  
internal SLO is in most cases not the SLO that is defined in the SLA

---

# Example SLA

99% availability - if it is below 99% we'll refund 2000 Euros; if it drops below 80% then, we'll refund 5000 Euros

---

# SLI

Choosing too many indicators makes it hard to pay the right level of attention to the indicators  
that matter, while choosing too few may leave significant behaviors of your system unexamined.

---

# Example SLI

- How frequently measurements are made: “Every 10 seconds”
- How the data is acquired: “Through our monitoring, measured at the server”
- Which requests are included: “HTTP GETs from monitoring jobs”

If you’re building a system from scratch, make sure that SLIs, SLOs and SLAs are part of your  
system requirements. If you already have a production system but don’t have them clearly defined  
then that’s your highest priority work.
