Svelte is a component framework like React or Vue

---

But what if this new framework comes up with a decent solution how to handle virtual DOM diffing
and not eat your frame budget or tax the garbage collector?

"Svelte runs at **build time** and converting your components into highly efficient imperative code that surgically updates the DOM"

[ ... ] (https://svelte.dev/)

---

But let us take a step back and look at the various advantages of svelte in detail

1. Less code
2. No virtual DOM
3. Size
... A11y, Typesafe, etc.

---

## 1. Less code

---

Let's write a simple app that has 2 numeric inputs and add them together

---

### React

```jsx
const Component = () => {
	const [first, setFirst] = useState(2)
	const [second, setSecond] = useState(3)

	const changeFirst = (e) => setFirst(e.currentTarget.value)
	const changeSecond = (e) => setSecond(e.currentTarget.value)

	return (
		<>
			<input type="number" value={first} onChange={changeFirst} />
			<input type="number" value={second} onChange={changeSecond} />

			<p>{first} + {second} = {first + second}</p>
		</>
	)
}
```

---

### Vue

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <input type="number" v-model.number="a">
    <input type="number" v-model.number="b">

    <p>{{a}} + {{b}} = {{a + b}}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    data: function() {
      return {
        a: 1,
        b: 2
      };
    }
  };
</script>
```

---

### Svelte

```html
<script>
	let a = 2;
	let b = 3;
</script>

<input type="number" bind:value={a}>
<input type="number" bind:value={b}>

<p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}</p>
```

---

### Advantages of Svelte

- No redundant top level elements (like fragments in React or template elements in Vue)
- Event and value are tightly coupled together and doesn't need to be seperated (like event handler and state values in React)
- No redundant state api for stateful variables (like useState in React)

---

## 2. No virtual DOM

(https://svelte.dev/blog/virtual-dom-is-pure-overhead)

---

---

"This is actually extremely fast, primarily because most DOM operations tend to be slow. There's been a lot of performance work on the DOM, but most DOM operations tend to drop frames."

[ ... ] 2013 Pete Hunt (React core team member)

---

First of all the virtual DOM model is not bad and the performance is *generally good enough*
and the diffing algorithm by React is extremly fast.

---

## So why we should **NOT** using the virtual DOM?

---

Let's look at some example code in React

```jsx
function MoreRealisticComponent(props) {
  const [selected, setSelected] = useState(null);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Selected {selected ? selected.name : 'nothing'}</p>

      <ul>
        {props.items.map(item =>
          <li>
            <button onClick={() => setSelected(item)}>
              {item.name}
            </button>
          </li>
        )}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

We're generating a virtual list of buttons each with their own inline event handler – **on every state change**.

Unless you're unhealthily obsessed with performance, you're not going to optimise that. There's no point. It's plenty fast enough. But you know what would be even faster? **Not doing that**.

[ ... ] https://svelte.dev

---

The danger of defaulting to doing unnecessary work, even if that work is trivial, is that your app will eventually succumb to 'death by a thousand cuts' with no clear bottleneck to aim at once it's time to optimise.

---

## 3. Size

---

Due to compiling svelte code to tiny **framework-less** vanilla JS – your App starts and stays fast.

---

# Coding Time

---

## Conclusion

Svelte has a fresh new and fast approach how to handle UI changes and stick to idiomatic syntax but that doesn't mean we need to
migrate all React or Vue Apps to Svelte. Svelte is just 3 month's old (stable) and don't have a solution for concurrent mode right now but we should
keep an eye on Svelte to be on the bleeding edge side of coding.
